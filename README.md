 * Clone the GitHub Repo onto your local machine

 * Make sure you have rails installed, if not look here http://installrails.com/

 * CD to the folder, and run `bundle install`

 * Run `rails db:migrate` to get the migrations

 * I suggest opening a new tab and in that tab run `rails s` to start the server.
